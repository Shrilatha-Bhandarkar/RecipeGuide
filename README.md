
●  We have built a recipe application using MERN stack(MongodB, Express, React, NodeJs), that allows users to search for recipes, save their favourite recipes, and share recipes with friends.
● The app also provides features for creating and sharing their own recipes with the community. Additionally, the application has a user login feature to save user preferences, and allow users to access their saved recipes across multiple devices.
● The frontend part is built using react whereas the backend part is built by using NodeJs and ExpressJs. The recipe application contains the following pages: a home page, login page, sign up page, a page with information about the builders, and a recipe page where they can add, delete or update recipes.
